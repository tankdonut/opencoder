A comprehensive harness for bootstrapping OpenCode environments with production-ready agents, skills, and commands. Includes containerized deployment for consistent, reproducible setups.

## Overview

OpenCode Harness bundles three powerful OpenCode plugin ecosystems as git submodules:

- **[everything-claude-code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code)** - 16 agents, 65 skills, 40 commands for production workflows
- **[oh-my-openagent](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent)** - Multi-agent orchestration system with 26 tools and 46 lifecycle hooks
- **[superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)** - Advanced workflow skills (TDD, debugging, git workflows)

This harness provides:

- **Bootstrap automation** - Setup scripts and containerized environments
- **Plugin ecosystem** - Pre-wired access to 3 major OpenCode plugin collections
- **Agent-ready documentation** - Comprehensive guides designed for AI assistants
- **Git submodule management** - Easy plugin updates and version control
